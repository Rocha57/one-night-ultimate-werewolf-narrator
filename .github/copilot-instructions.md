This project is a Vue.js web app for playing One Night Ultimate Werewolf. The app should allow users to:
- Select the number of players
- Choose which roles are in play
- Set a custom game timer
- Start the game, which plays a sequence of audio clips (start, roles, end)
- After the audio sequence, start a countdown timer for discussion

UI should be clean and user-friendly.
